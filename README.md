Technical Directions
---------------------
**Openshift**

Openshift offers hosting possibilities for various applications for free. It is possible to log in via ssh, and use port-forwarding for the database.

In order to use Openshift, an account is necessary. Afterwards, the rhc-app has to be installed:
https://www.openshift.com/developers/rhc-client-tools-install

With that, port-forwarding can be used:

	rhc port-forward â€“a python

The ssh-link is visible on the Openshift page within the application.

In the setup.py file, all the installed apps are listed. They are used on the Openshift server, but this file is also useful for local development.


**Database**

A MySQL database hosted on Openshift is used. Port-forwarding has to be enabled for local development.

phpMyAdmin is also installed on Openshift, in case a look into the database is desired.

In the settings.py the port is specified and may have to be adjusted depending on the port-forwarding.

**Search**

The search relies on Whoosh (a python search engine) and haystack as a middle layer. In order for the search index to rebuild, the following command has to be used in order to add new books:

	manage.py update_index


**E-Mails**
A gmail-account is used to send e-mails instead of an own smtp-server. The data is specified in the settings.py file.


**Setup.py**
Here, additional apps have to added in order to work on Openshift when pushing it on the server.
